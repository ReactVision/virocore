<h1 align="center">ViroCore</h1>

ViroCore is a high-performance 3D framework for Android (often described as “SceneKit for Android”). It provides a descriptive Java API for building 3D, AR, and VR apps, so you can focus on scene design, interactivity, and animations rather than low-level rendering.
