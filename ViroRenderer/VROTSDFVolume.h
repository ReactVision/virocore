/*
 A sparse truncated signed distance field, for fusing depth frames into a surface that persists
 across them.

 ARKit's scene reconstruction does this on LiDAR devices and hands back ARMeshAnchors, which is why
 the world mesh accumulates there and nowhere else. ARCore has no equivalent — it gives a depth
 image per frame and nothing more — so on Android, and on iPhones without LiDAR, the fusion has to
 live here. Without it the mesh, and the VPS Lite snapshot taken from it, is whatever the camera
 last pointed at.

 Storage is a hash of 8³ blocks, so only the space near observed surfaces costs anything: a voxel
 is 8 bytes, a block 4 KB. Blocks past the budget are evicted least-recently-seen first.

 Averaging is the point, not just persistence. A single ARCore depth frame is noisy; a voxel that
 several frames agree on converges on the real surface, which matters most for monocular depth.
